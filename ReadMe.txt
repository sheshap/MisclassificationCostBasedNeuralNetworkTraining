1) Open backprop+costmatrix.py file and adjust the values in the cost matrix based on the dataset
2) Modify line to read the right .csv file to read the data
3) Run backprop_costmatrix.py to get the accuracy of the network after being trained with misclassification costs
4) A file with name error.csv is also found with total amount of error being feed into the backpropagation algorithm after prediction in forward propagation
